# BudgetWise-Your-Itelligent-Financial-Companion
BudgetWise: Your Intelligent Financial Companion is a Java console app that helps users manage income and expenses. It records earnings, categorizes spending, shows summaries and percentages, and gives financial tips. It also saves all transactions in a text file for easy viewing, editing, or deletion.

# OOP Concepts applied
Encapsulation - The program uses encapsulation by keeping financial data such as income, expenses, and transaction details as private attributes within the respective classes and allowing access to them only through public getter and setter methods.

Abstraction - It is implemented by means of an abstract Display class that encapsulates the low level formatting operations and provides only the essential display functionalities to its subclasses.

Inheritance - The project features inheritance through the subclasses BannerDisplay and IconDisplay that extend the abstract Display class, thus inheriting is methods and structure.

Polymorphism - It occurs when different display classes and financial tip classes implement different versions of the same methods, in that way enabling the system to treat them as a single entity while generating different outputs.

# Program Structure
**Main class and their roles**

BudgetWiseApp - The main component that is responsible for managing the menu system.
BudgetTracker - Manages the income, expenses, breakdown, summary, and history.
Transaction - A model that encapsulates details of a single income or expense record.
Display subclasses - Are responsible for the visual banners and UI formatting.
FinancialTip interface - Serves as a source of dynamic financial suggestions.
